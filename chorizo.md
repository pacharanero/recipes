# Chorizo (Dry Cured) – 5 kg Batch

## Ingredients

### Meat

- 3 kg pork belly
- 1 kg lean pork shoulder (trimmed)
- 1 kg lean beef (e.g. sirloin trimmings)

### Seasoning & Additives

- 125 g fine salt
- 8 g potassium nitrate (saltpetre) OR 12 g Prague Powder #1 (see note)
- 10 g freshly ground black pepper
- 5 g ground nutmeg
- 5 g hot chili powder
- 150 g mild chili powder
- 20 g paprika
- 50 ml olive oil
- ~300 ml cold water (for dissolving spices, optional)

### Casings

- Pork casings 34–36 mm, cut in 50 cm lengths (soaked and rinsed)

## Instructions

1. Trim meat of tendons; cut into 2 cm cubes. Chill thoroughly (near-freezing) 12 hours or partially freeze until stiff.
2. Dissolve salt, curing salt (or adjusted nitrate), and spices in cold water (or add dry) then combine evenly with cubed meat.
3. Grind through 5–6 mm plate. Mix thoroughly until tacky and uniform.
4. Stuff loosely into prepared casings forming 50 cm rings; avoid overpacking to prevent smearing.
5. Hang sausages to drain 20–30 minutes refrigerated.
6. Pre-dry (étuvage) at ≤25°C (77°F) with airflow for ~6 hours to shrink casings.
7. Dry/cure at 12–15°C (54–59°F), 70–80% RH, with gentle airflow for 12–18 days, rotating for even drying.
8. Optional: Rub lightly with olive oil for sheen; avoid surface mold development typical of other styles.
9. Store wrapped in refrigerator several weeks; slice thinly to serve.
