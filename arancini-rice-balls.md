# Arancini (Stuffed Rice Balls)

## Ingredients

### Rice Balls

- 2 cups cooked rice or risotto (about 400–450 g cooked; warm if leftover)
- 1/4 cup bread crumbs (15–20 g)
- 2 tbsp all purpose flour (16 g)
- 1 tbsp corn starch (8 g)
- 1 small onion, finely chopped (80–100 g)
- 1 bell pepper, finely chopped (120–140 g)
- 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (or to taste)
- Salt, to taste (approx. 1/2–3/4 tsp fine salt for mix)
- Pepper, to taste
- 2 tbsp oil (30 ml) for sautéing
- 5 mozzarella cheese sticks, cut into 2–2.5 cm (1 inch) pieces (one core per ball)

### Breading

- 1 cup bread crumbs (60–70 g)
- 3 tbsp all purpose flour (24 g)
- 2 tbsp corn starch (16 g)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- About 60 ml water (add gradually) to make a thick batter

## Instructions

1. Mash rice/risotto to a soft paste (warm briefly if cold) so it binds.
2. Sauté onion and bell pepper in 1 tbsp of the oil over medium heat until soft; season with a pinch of salt and red pepper flakes. Cool slightly.
3. Combine mashed rice, sautéed vegetables, 1/4 cup (15–20 g) bread crumbs, 2 tbsp flour, and 1 tbsp corn starch; mix until cohesive. Adjust seasoning (salt/pepper).
4. Divide and form 5 balls (or smaller), inserting a mozzarella piece in the center; seal well.
5. Battering: In a bowl whisk 3 tbsp flour, 2 tbsp corn starch, salt, pepper with enough water (≈60 ml) to form a thick, clinging batter. Put remaining bread crumbs in a separate shallow dish.
6. Coat each ball in batter (wet hand) then roll in bread crumbs (dry hand). Arrange on a tray. Freeze 10–15 minutes to firm (optional) or freeze longer for later.
7. Air Fry: Preheat to 180°C / 360°F for 3 minutes. Lightly mist or brush balls with remaining oil. Cook 6 minutes, shake/turn, then another 5–6 minutes until deep golden and crisp.
8. Deep Fry: Heat 5 cm (2 inches) oil to 175–180°C (350–355°F). Fry 2–3 balls at a time 3–4 minutes, turning, until uniformly golden and cheese just melting. Drain on paper or a rack; season lightly with salt while hot.
