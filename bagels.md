# Bagels

## Ingredients

- 2 cups warm water (480 ml)
- 2 tbsp active dry yeast (18 g)
- 1 tsp brown sugar (optional for proofing) (4 g)
- 1/4 cup oil (60 ml)
- 1 tbsp salt (18 g)
- 5–6 cups flour (600–720 g total) – mix of white and whole wheat
- 4 qt water (3.8 L) for boiling
- 2 tbsp brown sugar (24 g) for boiling water

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 tsp brown sugar. Add oil, salt, and 4 cups (480 g) flour; mix, then knead in remaining flour until smooth and elastic (~10 minutes). Let rise covered until doubled.
2. Punch down; divide into 18 pieces. Roll each into a 15 cm (6 in) rope and form a ring, sealing ends.
3. Preheat oven to 190°C / 375°F. Bring 4 qt water + 2 tbsp brown sugar to a boil. Boil 4–5 bagels at a time: once they float, turn and boil 1 minute total.
4. Remove with slotted spoon to greased or parchment-lined tray. Bake 25–30 minutes until golden. Cool on rack.
5. Yield: 18 bagels.
