# Blanche de Chambly (Witbier Clone)

## Ingredients

- 3 lb (1.36 kg) Belgian pilsner malt
- 0.5 lb (227 g) flaked wheat
- 0.5 lb (227 g) flaked oats
- 3 lb (1.36 kg) wheat dry malt extract (unhopped)
- 1 oz (28 g) Saaz hop pellets – 40 min (approx 3–4% AA)
- 0.5 oz (14 g) cracked coriander seed – steep 10 min (post‑boil)
- 0.25 oz (7 g) dried Curaçao / bitter orange peel – steep 10 min
- 0.125 oz (3–4 g) grated dried ginger – steep 10 min
- Wit yeast: recultured Blanche de Chambly slurry OR Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Wit) / 3942
- 7/8 cup (175 g) corn sugar for priming
- Water: target light, low sulfate, moderate chloride (e.g. Ca 50 ppm, Cl 60–70 ppm, SO₄ < 50 ppm)

## Instructions

1. Mash pilsner malt, flaked wheat, and flaked oats in 2 gal (7.6 L) water at 150°F (65.5°C) for 60 minutes.
2. Sparge with 10 qt (9.5 L) water at 168°F (75.5°C); collect wort.
3. Stir in wheat DME; bring to a boil. Boil 10 minutes, then add Saaz hops and continue boiling 30 minutes (total 40 min from hop addition) or until volume/grav target reached (OG ~1.049).
4. After flameout reduce to a gentle below‑boil (or steep off‑heat) and add coriander, orange peel, and ginger in a mesh bag for 10 minutes; then remove.
5. Chill wort to 68–70°F (20–21°C); aerate and pitch yeast culture.
6. Ferment at 65–68°F (18–20°C) for 8–10 days until final gravity stable.
7. Optional brief cold crash (2–3 days) if clearer beer desired (style traditionally hazy).
8. Prime with 7/8 cup (175 g) corn sugar; bottle or keg to 2.6–2.8 vols CO₂. Condition 3–4 weeks cool dark place.
