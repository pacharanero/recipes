# Membrillo (Quince Paste)

## Ingredients

- 1.8 kg (4 lb) quince, washed, peeled, cored, chopped
- 1 vanilla pod, split
- 2 strips lemon peel (½ × 5 cm)
- 3 tbsp lemon juice
- Approx equal volume granulated sugar (1:1 with quince purée)

## Instructions

1. Place quince, vanilla pod, and lemon peel in large saucepan; cover with water. Bring to boil, then simmer covered until quince fork-tender (30–40 minutes).
2. Drain; discard vanilla pod (keep peel). Purée fruit with peel. Measure purée volume; add equal volume sugar and lemon juice in pan over medium-low heat.
3. Cook, stirring occasionally, until very thick and deep orange-pink (1–1½ hours).
4. Preheat oven to 52°C / 125°F. Line 20 cm (8 in) square pan with greased parchment. Spread paste evenly; dry in oven ~1 hour. Cool completely; slice.
