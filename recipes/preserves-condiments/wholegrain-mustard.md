# Wicked's Wholegrain Mustard

A homemade wholegrain mustard with excellent flavour and texture. The spiciness develops over time as it matures.

## Ingredients

- 115 g black mustard seeds
- 115 g yellow mustard seeds
- 85 ml cider
- 1-1.5 tbsp sea salt
- 85 ml cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp dark brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Soak the mustard seeds in the vinegar and cider for up to 24 hours to soften them. Add more water if they absorb everything.
2. Set aside half a cup of the vinegar and mustard seeds mixture.
3. Combine the remaining vinegar and mustard seed mixture, sugar, and salt in a food processor or with a stick blender.
4. Process until coarsely ground and thickened, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed.
5. Stir in the reserved vinegar and mustard seed mixture.
6. Using a funnel and spoon, portion mustard into sterilised jars.
7. Cover and let the mustard stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 days to allow the ingredients to meld and develop a well-rounded spiciness.
8. The longer it rests, the spicier it gets. Taste it often and once the desired spiciness has been reached, refrigerate and serve.

## Storage

Can be refrigerated for up to 6 months. Once refrigerated, the flavour will continue to mature but will not become more spicy.
