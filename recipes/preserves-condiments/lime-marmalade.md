# Lime Marmalade

A traditional citrus marmalade with the sharp, aromatic flavour of limes balanced with oranges.

## Ingredients

- 1 kg limes and oranges (mixed)
- 75 ml orange juice
- 2 kg demerara sugar
- 2.5 litres water

## Instructions

1. Slice fruit with a food processor or sharp knife.
2. Put fruit in a bowl with 2.5 litres water and leave to soak overnight.
3. Transfer to a preserving pan and bring to the boil. Simmer slowly until the peel is tender - approximately 2 hours.
4. Stir in orange juice and sugar, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
5. Boil rapidly until setting point is reached, about 20-25 minutes.
6. Test for set by placing a small amount on a cold plate - it should wrinkle when pushed with a finger.
7. Pour into sterilised jars and seal while hot.

## Storage

Keeps for up to 12 months in a cool, dark place once sealed. Refrigerate after opening.
