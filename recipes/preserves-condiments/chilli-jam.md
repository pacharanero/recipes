# Chilli Jam

A sweet and spicy jam perfect for cheese platters, burgers, or as a glaze for meats. Adjust the heat level by choosing milder or hotter chillies.

## Ingredients

- 750 g red or yellow sweet peppers
- 100 g jalape√±o or other chillies (adjust to taste)
- 50 g fresh root ginger
- Water or fruit juice (to cover vegetables in pan)
- 1 kg jam sugar
- 50 ml lime juice
- 1 tsp salt

## Instructions

1. Slice the peppers and chillies using a food processor or sharp knife.
2. Peel and grate the fresh ginger.
3. Add the peppers, chillies, and ginger to a large pan with enough water or fruit juice to just cover the vegetables.
4. Simmer gently until vegetables are softened, about 20-30 minutes.
5. Add the jam sugar, lime juice, and salt.
6. Bring to a rolling boil and cook until setting point is reached (when mixture coats the back of a spoon and holds a line when finger is drawn through it).
7. Pour into sterilised jars and seal while hot.

## Tips

- Use gloves when handling chillies to avoid irritation
- Remove seeds from chillies for milder heat
- Test for set by placing a small amount on a cold plate

## Storage

Keeps for up to 12 months in a cool, dark place once sealed. Refrigerate after opening and use within 4 weeks.
