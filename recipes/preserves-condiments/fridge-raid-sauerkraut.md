# Fridge Raid Sauerkraut

## Ingredients

- 400 g mixed hard vegetables (carrot, squash, beetroot, kohlrabi, turnip, radish, celeriac, broccoli stems – any combination you like), washed and grated or finely sliced
- 12 g sea salt
- Finely grated zest of 1 organic unwaxed lemon or 1/2 orange, to taste
- 1–3 tsp grated fresh ginger, to taste
- 1 small piece fresh turmeric or 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1–2 tsp caraway, cumin, or coriander seeds, whole or ground, to taste

## Instructions

1. Tip the grated vegetables into a large bowl, scatter over the salt, then add any optional extras you like.
2. Mix everything with your hands, and massage firmly for a few minutes, until the vegetables start to soften and release their juices.
3. Spoon the mixture into a large sterilised jar, press it down tightly, then pour in any brine from the bottom of the bowl and firmly push the vegetables beneath the liquid; if they are not fully submerged, top up with a splash of filtered water mixed with a tiny pinch of salt.
4. Place the lid loosely on top of the jar to allow the gases to escape, then leave at room temperature for at least four days, checking regularly until it is bubbling and the brine tastes lightly acidic.
5. For a deeper, more complex flavour, keep fermenting on the counter for longer.
6. For a milder kraut, seal and put in the fridge, where it will keep for four to six months.
