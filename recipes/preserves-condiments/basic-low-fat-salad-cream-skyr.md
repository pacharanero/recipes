# Basic Low-Fat Salad Cream with Skyr

## Ingredients

- 150 g plain unsweetened skyr
- 1–2 tbsp sherry vinegar (or cider vinegar, to taste)
- 1-2 tsp Dijon or English mustard (English is hotter; Dijon is smoother)
- 1/2 tsp sugar or runny honey (optional, to balance acidity)
- Fine sea salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl whisk together the skyr, 1 tsp vinegar, and the mustard until smooth.
2. Taste: if too sharp, add the sugar/honey; if it needs more brightness, add additional vinegar a few drops at a time; adjust mustard for heat.
3. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Cover and chill for 30 minutes to let flavours meld and the texture thicken slightly.

## Notes

- Consistency: For a looser dressing add 1–2 tsp cold water after chilling; for thicker, stir in an extra spoon of skyr.
- Variations: Add a pinch of turmeric for classic colour; a little chopped chive or parsley for a fresh herbal note.
- Storage: Keeps 3–4 days refrigerated in a sealed jar.
