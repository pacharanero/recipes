# Apple Chutney

## Ingredients

- 1kg peeled, chopped onions
- 1 litre malt vinegar
- 500g sultanas
- 2kg peeled, cored and chopped apples
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tbsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tbsp salt; 1kg sugar
- finely diced carrot, courgette, and cauliflower

## Instructions

1. Place the onions in the pan with a little of the vinegar and cook
   gently until soft, watching carefully as it will tend to stick and burn if not circulated and stirred well.

2. Add the apples, sultanas, spices and half the
   remaining vinegar to the pan. Cook slowly, stirring and scraping the base of the pan regularly, until soft and dark brown. More liquid is sometimes required depending on the type of apples (cookers are drier)

3. Add the salt, sugar and remaining vinegar, stir until sugar is dissolved and continue cooking until thick. Add the finely diced vegetables to cook gently so they are cooked but remain crunchy.

4. Pot into warm sterilised jars and seal.
