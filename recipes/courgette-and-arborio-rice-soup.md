# Courgette and Arborio Rice Soup

## Ingredients

- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 60 ml (¼ cup) olive oil
- 3 courgettes (≈680 g / 1½ lb), diced (not peeled)
- 2 tsp salt (to taste)
- ¼ tsp ground black pepper
- ¼ tsp ground nutmeg
- 1½ cups chopped plum tomatoes (fresh or canned)
- 6 cups chicken broth (1.4 L) (or vegetable stock)
- 1 cup arborio rice (≈200 g)
- 3 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 3 tbsp fresh basil, chopped
- Parmesan cheese, grated (to serve)

## Instructions

1. In a large saucepan heat olive oil over medium-low heat; cook onion and garlic until softened but not browned (≈8 minutes).
2. Add diced courgettes, salt, pepper, and nutmeg; increase heat to medium and cook, stirring, until courgette is barely tender (≈10 minutes).
3. Stir in tomatoes, broth, rice, parsley, and basil. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer.
4. Simmer until rice is tender (≈20 minutes). Adjust seasoning.
5. Serve hot (or at room temperature) with grated Parmesan. Soup will thicken on standing; loosen with a little stock or water if reheating.
