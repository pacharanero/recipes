# Reed Diffuser Blends (100 ml Formulas)

Each blend below is specified as a percentage and equivalent millilitres for a 100 ml batch. Use an appropriate reed diffuser base (e.g. Augeo) to 100%. Where noted, choose FCF (furanocoumarin-free) versions to minimise phototoxicity.

General usage guidance:

- For a lighter throw: keep total essential oils ~15%.
- For a stronger throw: go up to 20% (shown formulas typically 14–17%).
- Heavy/resinous materials (e.g. benzoin, vetiver) can slow wicking; keep them modest and balance with bright top notes.
- Add oils to a glass beaker, stir gently, then top with base and mix before filling the bottle. Allow to marry 24–48 h if possible.

### Tips & Adjustments

- To scale: multiply each ml value by desired batch size / 100.
- For slower diffusion reduce total EO load a couple percentage points.
- If blend clouds or separates, allow to rest; gentle warming (bain-marie) may help integrate.
- Always label with blend name, date, and allergen considerations.

### Safety Notes

- Keep away from children and pets; some oils (tea tree, clove) are more sensitising.
- FCF citrus reduces phototoxic risk if skin contact occurs.
- Avoid direct skin application: these are diffusion strengths, not topical dilutions.
