# Building a Smoker (Guide)

## Ingredients

- Basic fireplace or repurposed container (oil drum, dustbin, filing cabinet)
- Heat source (charcoal/wood/gas/electric element)
- Sawdust or wood chips (hardwood: oak, beech, fruit woods)
- Baffle plate (steel sheet) for cold smoking
- Hanging bars or hooks

## Instructions

1. Choose smoker body: chimney, metal bins, drum, or cabinet; ensure non-plastic interior.
2. Understand smoking modes: hot smoking (~100°C) cooks; cold smoking (25–30°C) preserves flavour/texture; maintain gentle smoke.
3. Fit baffle plate above small fire to smoulder damp hardwood sawdust, stabilising low temperature for cold smoking.
4. Regulate temperature by airflow (vents) and sawdust moisture; aim for warm (not hot) hand test for cold smoke.
5. For improvised twin-bin setup: smaller bin (without base) atop larger bin with holes; smoke rises through to hanging chamber.
6. Monitor and replenish smouldering sawdust every few hours; dampen if flaring. Experiment with woods (oak, beech, apple, juniper, hickory) for flavour.
7. Practice yields intuition; adjust heat, duration, and wood mix to taste.
