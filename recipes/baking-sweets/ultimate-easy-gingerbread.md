# Ultimate Easy Gingerbread

## Ingredients

- 100 g salted butter
- 3 tbsp golden syrup (45 ml)
- 100 g dark muscovado sugar
- 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1 tbsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 225 g plain flour
- Up to 1 tbsp milk (15 ml), if needed
- 50 g icing sugar
- 1–2 tbsp water for icing (15–30 ml)

## Instructions

1. Gently heat the butter, golden syrup, and dark muscovado sugar in a small pan until melted, stirring occasionally, then leave to cool slightly.
2. Mix the bicarbonate of soda, ground ginger, ground cinnamon, and plain flour in a large bowl. Pour in the melted mixture and stir to combine, then bring together with your hands to form a dough, adding a little milk if needed. The dough should be soft but will firm up when chilled.
3. Place the dough between two sheets of baking parchment, shape into a rectangle, and roll to about 5 mm thickness. Transfer the parchment-wrapped dough to a baking sheet and chill for 1 hour.
4. Heat the oven to 190°C / 170°C fan / Gas 5. Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment. Remove the dough from the fridge, cut out shapes with a 9 cm cutter or your preferred shape, and place on the prepared tray with space between each.
5. Bake for 10–12 minutes (adjusting for cutter size) until just set. Cool completely on the baking sheet.
6. Mix the icing sugar with 1–2 tbsp water to a thick, pipeable icing. Pipe over the cooled biscuits to decorate.
