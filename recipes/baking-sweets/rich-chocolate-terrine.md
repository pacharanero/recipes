# Chocolate Terrine

This is the sort of pudding for a special dinner party. It's rich in texture and taste and eats like a chocolate dream. One of the big advantages of making this dish is that it freezes so well and doesn't spoil. So if you've got a party coming up, make this now and just pop it in the freezer ready for the big day. The best size terrine mould to use is a Le Creuset 29 x 9 cm (11½ x 3½ in). The terrine mould is lined with a chocolate sponge, filled with a chocolate mousse and then coated with more chocolate.

**SERVES 12**

## For the Sponge

225 g (8 oz) caster sugar
100 g (4 oz) cocoa
5 eggs, separated

## For the Mousse

150 g (6 oz) good quality plain chocolate
300 ml (10 fl oz) double cream
175 g (6 oz) unsalted butter
4 eggs, separated
75 g (3 oz) cocoa
175 g (6 oz) caster sugar

## For the Chocolate Coating

120 ml (4 fl oz) milk
275 g (10 oz) good quality plain chocolate, chopped
65 ml (2½ fl oz) double cream
65 g (2½ oz) unsalted butter, chopped

## Method

Pre-heat the oven to 160°C/325°F/gas 3 and butter and line a 40 x 30 cm (16 x 12 in) baking tray. Line a 29 x 9 cm (11½ x 3½ in) terrine with greaseproof paper or cling film.

To make the sponge, mix half the sugar with the egg yolks and whisk until pale and fluffy. Whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks, then add the remaining sugar and continue to whisk to a stiff meringue. Fold the cocoa into the egg yolk mix, then whisk in a quarter of the meringue mix. Carefully and lightly fold in the remaining meringue. Spread the mix in the prepared tin. Bake in the pre-heated oven for about 20-30 minutes. Leave to cool.

To make the mousse, melt the chocolate with the butter in a bowl over a pan of warm water until it binds to a thick cream consistency. Add the cocoa and beat until completely smooth and cooled. Whisk the cream until it forms soft peaks, then chill. Whisk the egg yolks with half the sugar until white and fluffy. Fold into the chocolate mix. Whisk the egg whites with the remaining sugar to meringue stage, then fold into the chocolate mix. Now fold in the whipped cream.

Cut the cold sponge into four, making sure you measure from the mould, then line the base and sides, saving one piece for the top. Pour the chocolate mousse into the mould, then place the remaining piece of sponge on top. Chill for for 2-3 hours or freeze.

The chocolate coating finishes and really lifts the pudding. Bring the milk and cream to the boil, then pour on to the chocolate and butter. Stir until melted and blended. Cool until thick and at room temperature. To cover the terrine, remove from the fridge or freezer, spoon some on top and spread on until completely covered. Return to the fridge or freezer until set.

To finish, turn out the terrine on to a small board or tray, then spoon over the remaining chocolate coating and spread evenly over the sponge. The terrine will, of course, no longer fit in the mould and so can be kept chilled or frozen on the tray or board. Once the coating has completely set, just cover with cling film.

The terrine will make at least 12 portions. However, the finished dish can be cut into 4 and then frozen so that it can be eaten whenever you like.

## Variations

This pudding can be made a lot easier by simply sitting half the sponge into a lined flan case and then pouring the mousse on top and finishing with another layer of sponge. This can then be set in a fridge or freezer. Remove the flan ring and lining and finish with the chocolate coating. It will look like a rich chocolate cake but is in fact a rich chocolate mousse.

This chocolate pudding eats very well with either Orange Custard Sauce (see p.215) or Coffee Custard Sauce (see p.215).
