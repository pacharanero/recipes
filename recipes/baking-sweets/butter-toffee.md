# Butter Toffee (without thermometer)

A traditional butter toffee recipe that doesn't require a thermometer - perfect for home cooks.

## Ingredients

- 120 g butter
- 240 g granulated sugar
- 2 tbsp vinegar
- 2 level tbsp golden syrup

## Instructions

1. Use a heavy pan, not too small, as the mixture froths a little.
2. Place butter in pan over heat to begin. Add rest of ingredients, stir until sugar is melted.
3. Bring to boil and boil briskly, stirring very occasionally, until mixture turns golden brown.
4. Pour into greased, shallow tin (e.g. 7" square).
5. Mark into squares before fully set, which makes it easier to break.

## Tips

- Watch carefully during the final stages as toffee can burn quickly
- The mixture is ready when it turns a rich golden brown colour
- Work quickly when pouring as toffee sets fast

## Storage

Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
