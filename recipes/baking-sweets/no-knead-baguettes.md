# No-Knead Baguettes

Easy artisanal-style baguettes that require no kneading. The long fermentation develops excellent flavour and texture.

Makes 3-4 baguettes

## Ingredients

- 3 cups strong bread flour
- ½ tsp instant yeast (easy bake yeast)
- 1-1½ tsp salt
- 12 fl oz (350 ml) water
- 1 egg + 2 tsp water for egg wash (optional)

## Instructions

1. Mix all dry ingredients in a large bowl.
2. Add the water all in one go.
3. Stir round and round with the handle end of a wooden spoon until it forms a single big lump.
4. Cover and leave for 8-12 hours, over which time the gluten in the dough will hydrate itself without needing to be kneaded.
5. Scrape the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface, dust lightly with flour, form a ball and cut into 3 or 4 equal parts.
6. Roll and stretch out into thin baguette shapes, letting them rest for 10 minutes if they are too elastic to stretch out.
7. Place on a piece of parchment paper the same size as your baking stone, and leave to rise again for 1 hour.
8. Preheat oven (with your baking stone in it) to 230°C (450°F).
9. Optional: brush with egg wash for a shiny crust.
10. Bake on the baking stone for 15 minutes until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.

## Tips

- The long fermentation is key to developing flavour - don't rush this step
- A baking stone helps create a crispy crust, but a heavy baking sheet will work
- Score the tops with a sharp knife just before baking for a professional look

## Storage

Best eaten fresh on the day of baking. Can be frozen and reheated in the oven.
