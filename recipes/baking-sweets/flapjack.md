# Flapjack

## Ingredients

- 225 g (8 oz) rolled oats
- 170 g (6 oz) demerara sugar
- 170 g (6 oz) butter
- 115 g (4 oz) plain flour
- Pinch of salt

### Optional mix-ins (choose up to 150 g total)

- 30-60 g (¼-½ cup) chopped nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans)
- 30-60 g (¼-½ cup) seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame)
- 60-90 g (⅓-½ cup) dried fruit, chopped (raisins, sultanas, cranberries)

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 170°C / 340°F. Line a 20 cm (8 in) square tin with parchment.
2. Mix oats, flour, salt, and any chosen mix-ins in a large bowl.
3. Melt butter in a saucepan, add sugar, and stir until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture looks glossy.
4. Stir in the dry ingredients until fully combined; keep total mix-ins to 150 g, adding 15-30 g (1-2 tbsp) extra butter if the mixture looks dry.
5. Press the mixture firmly into the lined tin, smoothing the top.
6. Bake for 20 minutes, until lightly golden at the edges.
7. Cool in the tin, then slice into 18 pieces once set.
