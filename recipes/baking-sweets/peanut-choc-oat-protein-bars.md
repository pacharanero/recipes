# Peanut Chocolate Oat Protein Energy Bars

No-bake protein bars perfect for post-workout fuel or healthy snacks. Packed with peanut butter, oats, and protein powder.

Makes approximately 12 bars

## Ingredients

- 330 g (¾ cup) crunchy peanut butter
- ⅓ cup honey
- 2 tbsp deodorised coconut oil
- 2 cups rolled oats
- ½ cup chocolate protein powder (about 2 scoops)
- 3 tbsp flaxseeds, ground to powder
- ¼ tsp salt
- 25 g 70% cocoa chocolate, chopped into chips

## Instructions

1. Line an 8×8 or 9×9 inch baking pan with parchment paper.
2. Melt the peanut butter, honey, and coconut oil together in a double boiler or over hot water.
3. Add the oats, protein powder, ground flaxseed, and salt. Stir to combine.
4. The mixture will seem very dry at first but will come together as you stir. It won't be sticky but should hold together when pressed.
5. Fold in the chocolate chips.
6. Press mixture evenly into the prepared tray and refrigerate overnight.
7. Lift the bars from the pan using the parchment handles and transfer to a cutting board.
8. Slice into bars of desired size.

## Tips

- The consistency varies based on peanut butter brand. If too loose, add 1-2 tbsp extra oats.
- If too dry, add additional peanut butter, honey, or water, 1 tbsp at a time, until bars hold together.

## Storage

Store refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or freeze for up to 3 months.
