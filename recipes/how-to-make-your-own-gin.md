# How to Make Your Own Gin (Infused)

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp juniper berries (more for juniper-forward)
- 1 tsp coriander seeds
- 2 cardamom pods
- 2 black peppercorns
- ½ cinnamon stick
- Small piece dried orange peel (pith removed)
- Small piece dried lemon peel (pith removed)
- 750 ml plain vodka (base spirit)

## Instructions

1. Sterilise a wide-mouth jar with boiling water; allow to cool.
2. Add all botanicals except fresh peels if using fresh (here using dried).
3. Pour in vodka; seal and store in a cool dark place 24 hours.
4. Taste; if balanced add peels (if not already dried) to boost citrus and infuse up to another 24 hours, tasting periodically.
5. Strain through fine sieve; filter through coffee filter or muslin if clearer spirit desired.
6. Rest 1–2 days to settle; bottle. Some colour is normal for compound gin.
