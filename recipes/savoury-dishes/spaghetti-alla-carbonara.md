# Spaghetti alla Carbonara

## Ingredients

- 350 g (12 oz) dried spaghetti
- 200 g (7 oz) pancetta or smoked streaky bacon, cut into small lardons
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 50 g (1¾ oz) Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated, plus extra to serve
- 50 g (1¾ oz) Parmesan cheese, finely grated, plus extra to serve
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Sea salt, for the pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente according to the packet instructions. Reserve a mug of the cooking water before draining.
2. While the pasta cooks, heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the pancetta and garlic and cook for 5–6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the fat renders and the meat turns crisp and golden. Discard the garlic cloves.
3. In a mixing bowl whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, Pecorino, Parmesan, and a generous amount of black pepper until smooth.
4. Tip the drained spaghetti into the pan with the pancetta and toss to coat in the rendered fat. Remove the pan from the heat, pour over the egg and cheese mixture, and stir vigorously, loosening with a little reserved cooking water as needed to create a silky sauce that clings to the pasta.
5. Season to taste with additional pepper, divide between warm bowls, and serve immediately with extra grated cheese.
