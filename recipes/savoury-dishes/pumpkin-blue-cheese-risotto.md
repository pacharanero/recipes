# Pumpkin & Blue Cheese Risotto

A creamy autumn risotto balancing sweet roasted pumpkin with the tang and savoury depth of blue cheese. Finished with fresh thyme and a little lemon for lift.

## Ingredients

- 500 g pumpkin or butternut squash, peeled, de-seeded, cut in 1–1.5 cm dice
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (divided)
- 1 small onion (or 2 shallots), finely diced
- 1 rib celery, finely diced (optional but adds aroma)
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 250 g arborio or carnaroli rice
- 120 ml dry white wine (about 1/2 cup)
- 1 litre hot vegetable stock (keep gently simmering)
- 60 g crumbly blue cheese (e.g. Danish Blue, Stilton), roughly crumbled
- 25 g finely grated Parmesan or vegetarian hard cheese (optional for extra umami)
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves (or 1 tsp dried)
- Zest of 1/2 lemon + 1–2 tsp juice (to taste)
- 10 g unsalted butter or 1 tsp extra olive oil (for final sheen)
- Sea salt & freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Optional garnish:

- Extra thyme leaves
- Toasted pumpkin seeds
- Additional blue cheese crumbs

## Instructions

1. Roast Pumpkin: Heat oven to 200°C (180°C fan). Toss diced pumpkin with 1 tbsp olive oil, a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast on a lined tray 18–22 minutes until tender and lightly caramelised at edges. Keep warm.
2. Base Aromatics: In a wide heavy saucepan, warm remaining 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add onion (and celery if using) with a pinch of salt; cook 5–7 minutes until translucent, not browned. Stir in garlic; cook 30–45 seconds until fragrant.
3. Toast Rice: Add rice; stir 1–2 minutes until edges look slightly translucent and grains are well coated.
4. Deglaze: Pour in white wine; simmer, stirring, until mostly absorbed (about 1–2 minutes).
5. Gradual Stock Addition: Add hot stock a ladle at a time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be mostly absorbed before the next. Maintain a gentle simmer—not a boil. Continue 16–20 minutes until rice is creamy and al dente (core has slight resistance but no chalkiness). You may not need all the stock or may add a splash of hot water.
6. Fold & Enrich: Gently fold in roasted pumpkin, thyme, blue cheese and Parmesan (if using). Stir off the heat until cheese softens into the rice. Add butter (or extra oil), lemon zest and a little lemon juice. Adjust salt and pepper (blue cheese is salty—taste first).
7. Rest & Serve: Cover pan off heat 1 minute to relax starches. If too thick, loosen with a splash of hot stock. Serve immediately in warm bowls; garnish as desired.

## Tips & Adjustments

- Texture: Final risotto should flow slowly on a tilted plate—add a ladle of stock right at the end if it seizes.
- Cheese Choice: Balance a milder blue (Danish, Gorgonzola dolce) with a sharper crumble for complexity.
- Herb Variations: Swap thyme for sage (finely chopped) added with garlic.
- Protein Additions: Fold in shredded roast chicken or crisp pancetta at the end (not vegetarian).

## Make Ahead

- Roast pumpkin up to 2 days ahead; keep covered and refrigerated.
- Reheat leftover risotto gently with extra stock; quality best fresh.
