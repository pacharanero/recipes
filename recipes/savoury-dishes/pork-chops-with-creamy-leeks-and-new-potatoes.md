# Pork Chops with Creamy Leeks & New Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 700 g new potatoes, halved or quartered if large
- 500 g pork loin chops (4 x 125 g), fat trimmed
- Cooking spray
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 3 large leeks, trimmed and thinly sliced
- 1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- 200 g half-fat crème fraîche
- Zest of 1 lemon, plus wedges to serve
- 1 tbsp fresh parsley, roughly chopped, plus extra to serve

## Instructions

1. Cook the potatoes in boiling water 12-15 minutes until just tender, then drain and set aside.
2. Mist a large pan with cooking spray over a medium heat. Add the pork chops and garlic and cook 3 minutes, then turn and cook 2 minutes until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
3. Mist the pan with more cooking spray, add the leeks and cook 4-5 minutes until softened. Stir in both mustards, the crème fraîche and the lemon zest.
4. Season, bring to a simmer, stir in the parsley, then remove from the heat.
5. Scatter over extra parsley and serve with leeks, new potatoes and lemon wedges.
