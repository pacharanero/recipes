# Crispy Air-Fryer Onion Bhajis (Minimal Oil)

## Ingredients (makes about 8-10 bhajis)

### Base

- 2 medium onions (about 300-350 g), finely sliced
- 75 g gram flour (besan)
- 1 tbsp rice flour or cornflour

### Spices

- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/2-1 tsp chilli powder, to taste
- 1/2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp salt

### Extras (optional)

- 1 green chilli, very finely chopped
- 1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
- 1/2 tsp ajwain (carom seeds) or nigella seeds

### Fat

- 1-1 1/2 tsp neutral oil (rapeseed or sunflower)
- Optional: oil spray for finishing

## Instructions

1. Put the sliced onions and salt in a mixing bowl. Massage for 2-3 minutes until the onions soften and release moisture.
2. Add gram flour, rice flour (or cornflour), spices, optional extras, and 1-1 1/2 tsp oil. Mix thoroughly to make a sticky, claggy mixture that just holds together.
3. Only if needed, add water 1 tsp at a time until the mixture binds. Keep added water to an absolute minimum.
4. Preheat the air fryer to 200 C for 3-5 minutes.
5. Form rough, loose mounds rather than compact balls so the edges stay ragged and crisp.
6. Arrange on a perforated tray or in a basket with a perforated liner. Optionally spray the tops lightly with oil.
7. Air fry at 200 C for 8 minutes.
8. Flip carefully and cook for another 6-8 minutes until deep golden, crisp, and cooked through.
9. Serve immediately with mint yoghurt, tamarind chutney, or lemon wedges and a little salt.

## Notes

- Rice flour improves crispness and reduces sogginess.
- Onion moisture gives better flavour and reduces the need for added water.
- Starting hot helps set the crust quickly.

## Variations

- Extra crisp: add 1/2 tsp baking powder.
- Oil-free: omit oil entirely; expect a little less browning.
- Gluten-free: naturally gluten-free as written.
