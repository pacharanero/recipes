# Hungarian Beef Goulash

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 280 g (10 oz) onions, finely chopped
- ½ green bell pepper, deseeded & crushed or finely chopped
- 4 large garlic cloves, chopped
- 450 g (1 lb) beef chuck or shank, cubed
- 2 tbsp Hungarian sweet paprika
- ¼ tsp black pepper
- ¼ tsp hot pepper flakes or cayenne
- ½ tsp caraway seeds
- 800 g (28 oz) canned tomatoes, crushed by hand
- 2 bay leaves
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in heavy casserole. Add onions and bell pepper; cover and sweat until translucent (do not brown). Add garlic; cook 1 minute.
2. Add beef; season lightly with salt; cover and sweat several minutes until exterior is no longer raw.
3. Add paprika, black pepper, hot pepper, caraway, and bay leaves; cook gently 10–15 minutes so meat absorbs spices.
4. Add crushed tomatoes; bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender (~1 hour). Adjust seasoning; remove bay leaves.
5. Serve with buttered egg noodles (optional).
