# Curry Goat (Serves 5–6)

## Ingredients

- 3 large tomatoes, skinned and roughly chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, crushed then chopped
- 2 onions, finely chopped
- 1–2 Scotch bonnet chillies, deseeded and finely chopped
- Few sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried)
- Good bunch coriander (roots/stalks for marinade; leaves to finish)
- 2 tbsp HP sauce (optional)
- 50 g clarified butter (or neutral cooking oil)
- Salt (to taste)

### Jamaican Curry Blend

- 1 tbsp coriander seeds
- 1 tbsp black peppercorns
- 12 cardamom pods
- 1 tbsp fenugreek seeds
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 tbsp ground ginger
- 1 tbsp ground turmeric

- 1.5–2 kg goat or mutton stewing cuts (shoulder, scrag end, neck chops; bone-in pieces welcome)

## Instructions

1. Make curry blend: dry-roast coriander seeds, peppercorns, cardamom pods, fenugreek seeds, and cinnamon stick in a dry pan 1–2 minutes until fragrant; grind. Mix with ground ginger and turmeric.
2. Cut meat into chunky pieces (2–3 cm). Trim only excess hard fat.
3. In a large bowl combine 2 level tbsp of the curry blend with tomatoes, garlic, onions, chillies, thyme leaves (stripped and bruised), chopped coriander roots/stalks, and optional HP sauce.
4. Add meat; massage marinade thoroughly into all surfaces. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours (overnight preferred).
5. Remove meat; shake off loose marinade solids (reserve them). Brown meat in clarified butter in batches; transfer to a heavy casserole.
6. Fry reserved marinade solids until onions soften. Add to casserole. Deglaze pan with a splash of water; add juices to pot. Add just enough water to cover meat lightly and 1 tsp salt (adjust later).
7. Bring to a gentle simmer (or very low oven 120°C / 250°F). Cook 2.5–3 hours until meat tender and sauce thickened. Add small amounts of water if drying.
8. Adjust seasoning; sprinkle with chopped coriander leaves. Serve with plain rice, fried plantain, and chutneys.
