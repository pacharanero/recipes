# Creamy Spinach-Stuffed Chicken with Courgette

## Ingredients

- 75 g spinach
- 75 g medium-fat soft cheese
- 20 g Parmesan, finely grated
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 4 chicken breasts (about 200 g each)
- 4 medium courgettes
- Cooking spray
- 400 g cherry tomatoes
- 100 g rocket
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 200°C (fan 180°C / gas 6). Pour boiling water over the spinach in a colander to wilt. Cool, squeeze dry and roughly chop.
2. Mix the soft cheese, Parmesan, mustard and garlic with black pepper and a pinch of salt. Stir in the spinach.
3. Cut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast and stuff each with a quarter of the mixture.
4. Peel the courgettes lengthways into wide ribbons. Wrap 10-12 ribbons around each chicken breast, overlapping and tucking underneath.
5. Put on a lined roasting tray, mist with cooking spray and season. Bake 5 minutes.
6. Add the cherry tomatoes around the chicken, mist and season, then bake 20 minutes until cooked through.
7. Serve with rocket drizzled with balsamic vinegar.
