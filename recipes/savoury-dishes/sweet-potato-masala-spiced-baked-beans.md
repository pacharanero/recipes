# Sweet Potato with Masala-Spiced Baked Beans

## Ingredients

- 4 medium sweet potatoes (about 150 g each)
- Cooking spray
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1 fresh chilli (red or green), finely diced
- 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 3 tbsp tomato puree
- 2 large cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cinnamon stick
- ~400 ml water (enough to loosen and simmer sauce)
- 4 tbsp 0% fat Greek yogurt (to serve)
- 10 g fresh coriander, roughly chopped (to serve)

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 200°C (fan 180°C / gas 6). Mist sweet potatoes with cooking spray, season, and place in a roasting tin. Bake about 60 minutes until tender when pierced.
2. Midway through roasting, mist a large non-stick frying pan and cook onion over medium-low heat 6–8 minutes until softened; add a splash of water if it starts to stick.
3. Add chilli, ginger, and garlic; cook 1 minute. Stir in coriander, cumin, turmeric, and tomato puree; cook 1 further minute to bloom spices.
4. Add cannellini beans, cinnamon stick, and about 400 ml water. Stir, bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer 10 minutes until sauce thickens slightly. Remove cinnamon stick.
5. Split each baked sweet potato (cut a cross and squeeze). Spoon over spiced beans. Top each with a spoon of yogurt and scatter with fresh coriander.
