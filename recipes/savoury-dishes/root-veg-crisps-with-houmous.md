# Root Veg Crisps with Houmous

## Ingredients

- 1 medium carrot
- 1 medium parsnip
- 150 g sweet potato
- 1 small beetroot
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 large can chickpeas, drained (reserve the liquid)
- 150 g roasted red peppers in brine, drained
- 1 fresh chilli
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tbsp tahini
- 1 garlic clove
- 15 ml fresh lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 180°C (fan 160°C / gas 4). Trim the vegetables and slice very thinly. Pat dry with kitchen paper.
2. Toss the veg slices with the oil and paprika. Lay on lined baking trays and bake 16-18 minutes until crisp and golden (remove pieces as they’re done). Season and cool on a rack.
3. Blitz the chickpeas with roasted peppers, chilli, cayenne, tahini, garlic and lemon juice until smooth. Loosen with a little reserved chickpea liquid if needed. Season to taste.
4. Serve the houmous with the crisps for dipping.
