# Broad Bean Sauce

## Ingredients

- Fresh young broad beans (pods about 10–12 cm / 4–5 in long), strings removed, sliced 2–3 cm (1 in) pieces
- 1 medium onion, finely sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil (30 ml)
- Pinch ground coriander (or crushed seeds)
- Salt, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste
- Plain yogurt (optional, to serve)

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a wide pan over medium heat; gently fry onion 4–5 minutes until translucent. Add garlic; cook 1 minute.
2. Add sliced broad beans, coriander, salt, and pepper. Cover and simmer gently 5–8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender and mixture forms a loose sauce.
