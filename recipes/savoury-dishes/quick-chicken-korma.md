# Quick Chicken Korma

## Ingredients

- Cooking spray
- 640 g skinless chicken breast, diced
- 1 large onion, roughly chopped
- 15 g fresh ginger, roughly chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 tsp cardamom pods, crushed
- 60 g korma paste
- 1 chicken stock cube, made up to 400 ml
- 40 g ground almonds
- 2 tsp mango chutney
- 75 g 0% fat Greek yogurt
- 200 g green beans
- 2 pouches microwave brown rice
- 20 g flaked almonds, toasted

## Instructions

1. Mist a large deep nonstick pan with cooking spray and set over a high heat. Season the chicken, then cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes until golden. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
2. Put the onion, ginger and garlic into a food processor with 2 1/2 tbsp water and blitz to a smooth paste. Add the onion mixture to the pan, along with the cinnamon and cardamom, and cook 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Stir in the korma paste and cook 1 minute.
3. Add the stock and ground almonds and whisk until combined. Return the chicken (and any resting juices) to the pan and simmer 10 minutes until cooked through.
4. Remove from the heat and stir through the chutney and yogurt until combined.
5. Cook the beans in boiling water for 4-5 minutes until tender. Cook the rice to pack instructions.
6. Serve the chicken on a bed of rice with flaked almonds scattered over and green beans on the side.
