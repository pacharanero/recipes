# Sausage & Bean Casserole

## Ingredients

- Cooking spray
- 8 medium reduced-fat pork sausages, grilled
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped
- 2 yellow peppers, deseeded and thinly sliced
- 2 large cans chopped tinned tomatoes
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 large cans butter beans, drained and rinsed
- 280 g sourdough bread, sliced (4 x 70 g)
- 2 garlic cloves, halved
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped (to garnish)

## Instructions

1. Mist a deep nonstick pan with cooking spray and set over a medium-high heat. Add the sausages, onion and peppers and cook 6-8 minutes until the sausages are cooked through and the vegetables are tender.
2. Stir in the tomatoes and Worcestershire sauce and season well. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer 10 minutes until thickened. Stir in the beans and simmer 2 minutes.
3. Set a griddle pan over a high heat. Mist the bread with cooking spray, then griddle 1-2 minutes each side. Remove and rub the cut sides with the garlic.
4. Serve the casserole with the toast on the side and parsley scattered over.
