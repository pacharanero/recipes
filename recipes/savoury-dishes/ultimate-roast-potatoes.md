# Ultimate Roast Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 1kg Maris Piper potatoes
- 100g duck or goose fat (for a luxurious taste), or 100ml/3½fl oz olive oil
- 2 tsp flour
- Sea salt flakes, to serve

## Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 with a roasting tin inside large enough for the potatoes in a single layer.
2. Peel the potatoes and cut into 5cm chunks (2–3 pieces for smaller potatoes, 4 for medium).
3. Put the potatoes in a large pan and add just enough water to barely cover.
4. Salt the water, bring to a rolling boil, reduce the heat, and simmer uncovered for 2 minutes.
5. Put the fat or oil in the hot roasting tin and return to the oven for a few minutes until very hot.
6. Drain the potatoes in a colander, shaking to rough up the edges.
7. Sprinkle over the flour and shake again to coat evenly.
8. Carefully add the potatoes to the hot fat, turning to coat, and spread in a single layer.
9. Roast for 15 minutes, turn the potatoes, roast another 15 minutes, then turn again.
10. Continue roasting for 10–20 minutes more, until unevenly golden and crisp.
11. Scatter with sea salt flakes and serve immediately.
