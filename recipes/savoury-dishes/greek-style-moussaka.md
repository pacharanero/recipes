# Greek Style Moussaka

## Ingredients

- 4 medium aubergines, sliced into 1 cm rounds
- Cooking spray
- 1 medium onion, roughly chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 200 g extra-lean beef mince (5% fat)
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 large cans chopped tinned tomatoes
- 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- 200 g fat-free natural fromage frais
- 100 g fat-free plain quark
- 1 tsp smooth mustard
- 1 medium egg

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 200°C (fan 180°C / gas 6). Lay aubergine slices on baking trays, season, mist with cooking spray and bake 15-20 minutes until golden and nearly dried out.
2. Mist a frying pan with cooking spray and sauté the onions and garlic 5 minutes, adding a little water if they stick. Add the mince and stir to break up and brown.
3. Add the Worcestershire sauce, tomatoes, cinnamon, parsley and seasoning. Bring to the boil, then simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes until thick.
4. Beat together the fromage frais, quark, mustard and egg.
5. Layer the aubergines with the mince mixture in an ovenproof dish. Pour over the cheese sauce.
6. Bake 45 minutes until bubbling and golden.
