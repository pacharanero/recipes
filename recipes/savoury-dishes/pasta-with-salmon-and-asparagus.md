# Pasta with Salmon and Asparagus

## Ingredients

- 100 g asparagus
- Cooking spray
- 1 garlic clove, finely chopped
- 1/4 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 150 g salmon fillet, grilled
- 110 g white pasta (gigli or farfalle)
- Salt and pepper
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 100 g medium-fat soft cheese
- 1 tsp fresh dill

## Instructions

1. Snap off the woody ends of the asparagus. Cut each stalk crosswise diagonally into 2.5 cm pieces.
2. Heat cooking spray in a nonstick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add garlic and chilli flakes and sauté 30 seconds. Add the salmon and cook 3 minutes each side.
3. Cook the pasta in lightly salted boiling water according to pack instructions, adding the asparagus 3 minutes before the end. Drain well, return to the pan, add lemon juice and soft cheese, and stir over a low heat for 1 minute.
4. Break the salmon into bite-sized chunks, removing any skin and bones. Add to the pasta, toss gently and serve sprinkled with black pepper and dill.
