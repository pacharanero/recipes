# Ham Béchamel Croquettes

Creamy, silky ham croquettes with a thick, well-seasoned béchamel base that chills firm enough to shape, then fries to a crisp golden shell. Perfect for tapas or a make‑ahead party nibble.

## Ingredients

### Béchamel Base

- 80 g unsalted butter
- 90 g plain flour (plus extra for dredging)
- 800 ml whole milk (cold)
- 1 small onion, very finely diced (optional but adds sweetness)
- 1 bay leaf
- Freshly grated nutmeg (generous pinch)
- 150 g finely diced cured ham (Serrano / good cooked ham)
- 30 g finely grated Manchego or Parmesan (optional umami boost)
- 1 tsp fine sea salt (adjust to taste; ham saltiness varies)
- 1/2 tsp white or black pepper

### Crumbing & Frying

- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 150–200 g fine dried breadcrumbs (Panko lightly crushed or regular)
- Plain flour (for first dredge)
- Neutral frying oil (sunflower/groundnut) – enough for a 5–6 cm depth

### To Finish (Optional)

- Lemon wedges
- Finely chopped flat‑leaf parsley

## Instructions

1. Infuse Milk (Optional but recommended): Place milk, bay leaf and diced onion in a saucepan. Bring just to a simmer, switch off heat, cover and steep 10 minutes. Remove bay. (Strain out onion if you want an ultra-smooth interior; otherwise leave the very fine dice.)
2. Make Roux: Melt butter over medium heat in a wide heavy saucepan. Stir in flour and cook 2–3 minutes, stirring, until it smells toasty but not browned.
3. Build Béchamel: Off the heat, add about 1/4 of the milk and whisk vigorously until smooth. Return to gentle heat and add the rest in 3–4 additions, whisking each fully lump‑free before the next. Cook 4–6 minutes, stirring with a spatula, until thick, glossy and slow to fall from the spoon (thicker than a sauce; it should hold a line when you drag the spatula).
4. Season & Enrich: Fold in ham, cheese (if using), nutmeg, pepper and most of the salt (reserve a little, taste and adjust). The mixture should be savoury but not aggressively salty.
5. Chill Firm: Spread the mixture 1.5–2 cm thick in a shallow tray (lined with baking paper or lightly oiled). Press cling film directly on the surface to prevent a skin. Chill at least 3 hours (overnight best) until fully set.
6. Shape: Flour your hands. Cut slab into bars or scoop portions (about 30 g). Roll into cylinders or ovals. If mixture softens, return pieces to the fridge briefly.
7. Crumb Coat: Arrange three shallow dishes: seasoned flour, beaten eggs, breadcrumbs. Dredge each croquette in flour (shake excess), dip in egg, then breadcrumbs. For an extra crisp shell, rest 5 minutes and repeat egg + breadcrumb step (double coating).
8. Fry: Heat oil to 180°C. Fry in small batches (don’t crowd) 2–3 minutes until deep golden. Turn gently for even colour. Remove with a spider to paper towel. Keep batches warm in a low oven (100°C) if needed.
9. Serve: Sprinkle with parsley, add a squeeze of lemon if desired, and serve hot while the centre is creamy.

## Make Ahead & Storage

- Chill the shaped, breaded croquettes up to 24 h before frying.
- Or freeze on a tray, then bag. Fry from frozen at 170–175°C a little longer (watch colour).
- Leftovers: Re‑crisp 8–10 minutes at 190°C in an air fryer or hot oven.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- Mixture too loose: Cook béchamel a few minutes longer to evaporate moisture; or whisk in 1–2 tsp extra flour (raw) then simmer 2 more minutes.
- Floury taste: Roux was undercooked—ensure that initial 2–3 minute toasting step.
- Leaking croquettes: Seal cracks before crumbing; avoid overfilling with ham pieces.
- Pale exterior: Oil temperature too low; allow recovery between batches.
