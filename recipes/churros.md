# Churros

## Ingredients

- 200 g plain flour
- 250 ml water (¼ litre)
- ¼ tsp fine salt (1–2 g)
- 1 large egg
- Neutral olive or vegetable oil (for deep frying)
- Caster sugar (for coating)

## Instructions

1. Bring the water and salt just to the boil. While heating, place flour in a bowl.
2. Pour hot water gradually into the flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until a smooth, thick paste forms.
3. Beat in the egg until the dough is glossy and smooth with no lumps. Rest 5 minutes while heating oil (deep frying pan, ~170–175°C / 338–347°F).
4. Spoon dough into a piping (forcing) bag fitted with a large star/fluted nozzle.
5. Pipe 10–15 cm (4–6 in) lengths (or spirals) directly into the hot oil, cutting off with scissors or a knife. Avoid overcrowding.
6. Fry until golden brown, turning once (≈2–3 minutes total). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
7. Roll warm churros in caster sugar and serve immediately.
