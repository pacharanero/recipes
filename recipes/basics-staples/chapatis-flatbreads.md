# Chapatis - Flatbreads - Tortillas

Versatile flatbreads perfect as a side or wrap. Uses simple ingredients and a hot water dough technique.

Yield: 12 × 6" rounds

## Ingredients

- 415 g (1¾ cups plus 1 tbsp) water
- 1 tsp salt
- 290 g (2¼ cups) whole wheat flour, plus more for shaping

## Instructions

1. Put the water and salt in a medium saucepan, bring to a rolling boil, and remove from the heat.
2. Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to integrate.
3. Cover the pot with a lid and let the mixture sit for 2 minutes to let the flour fully hydrate.
4. Transfer the flour mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low until the dough is smooth and doesn't stick to your hands when you touch it, about 4 minutes.
5. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead lightly until the dough is smooth, about a minute.
6. Roll the dough into a thick rope and use a bench scraper to cut the dough into 12 equal pieces (each should weigh about 57g/2 oz).
7. Roll each piece into a ball on the work surface. Press each ball into a 2-inch disk.
8. With a floured rolling pin, roll each disk into a thin round measuring 6 inches in diameter.
9. Meanwhile, heat a large griddle or cast iron skillet over medium high heat.
10. Line a basket with a clean kitchen towel.
11. Working with 1 chapatti at a time, cook the chapatti on the first side for just 15 seconds.
12. Turn the chapati and cook on the second side until the underside is barely browned and the edges are dry, about 45 seconds.
13. Turn the chapati again and cook until the first side is lightly browned, about 30 seconds to 1 minute depending on the heat.
14. The chapati will puff up as it cooks—this means the water in the dough is steaming and making the chapati tender. The chapatti will deflate as it cools.
15. Transfer the cooked chapati to the basket and cover with the ends of the towel to keep warm while you continue cooking the remaining chapatis.

## Storage

Best served fresh and warm. Can be stored wrapped in a tea towel for a few hours or refrigerated for up to 2 days.
