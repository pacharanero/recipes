# Olive Oil Béchamel Sauce

A lighter (and lactose-friendly if using lactose-free milk) classic white sauce made with extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. Smooth, versatile, and ready to flavor for cheese sauces, gratins, croquettes or pasta bakes.

## Ingredients

- 60 ml (4 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil (medium, not overly peppery)
- 60 g plain flour
- 1 litre whole or semi-skimmed milk (cold)
- 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt (to taste)
- 1/4 tsp white or black pepper

Optional enrichments (choose any):

- 1 bay leaf (steep in milk, remove)
- Small piece onion, studded with 2 cloves (for classic infusion, remove)
- 1–2 tbsp finely grated Parmesan or Manchego (for cheese variant)

## Instructions

1. (Optional infusion) Place milk with bay leaf and/or clove-studded onion in a saucepan. Bring just to a bare simmer, cover, and steep 10 minutes. Remove aromatics. Cool slightly so milk is warm, not hot.
2. Heat olive oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in flour and stir continuously 2–3 minutes until foamy and slightly blond (do not brown). This cooks out raw flour taste.
3. Off the heat, whisk in about 150–200 ml of the milk until a smooth paste forms. Return to gentle heat and gradually add remaining milk in 4–6 additions, whisking each time until lump-free before adding more.
4. Once all milk is incorporated, switch to a silicone spatula and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom, 6–8 minutes until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (nappe) and a line drawn with a finger holds.
5. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add cheese now if using; stir until melted and smooth. Taste and adjust salt/pepper.
6. Use immediately, or cover the surface directly with baking parchment or cling film to prevent a skin if holding. For later use, cool quickly and refrigerate up to 3 days.

## Consistency Adjustments

- Thinner: Whisk in hot milk (or water) a splash at a time.
- Thicker: Simmer a few extra minutes, stirring; or whisk 1 tsp flour with 2 tbsp cold milk and cook 2 minutes more.

## Variations

- Cheese Sauce: Stir in 80–120 g grated mature cheese off heat.
- Mustard: Add 1–2 tsp Dijon with the seasoning.
- Herb: Fold in finely chopped parsley, chives, or tarragon at the end.
- Croquette Base: Increase flour to 70 g and reduce milk to 850 ml for a stiffer paste.

## Storage & Reheating

- Refrigerate tightly covered up to 3 days.
- Reheat gently over low heat, whisking; add a splash of milk if overly thick.
- Freeze (airtight) up to 1 month; thaw overnight and re-emulsify with whisk + a little fresh milk.
