# Marcus' Recipe Book

Welcome to my personal collection of cooking, brewing, preserving and DIY utility recipes. This site is intentionally plain: fast to browse, easy to maintain, and entirely Markdown driven.

## Structure

- [Baking & Sweets](baking-sweets/bagels.md)
- [Preserves & Condiments](preserves-condiments/apple-chutney.md)
- [Basics & Staples](basics-staples/two-ingredient-naan-breads.md)
- [Brewing & Ferments](brewing-ferments/adelscott-malt-liquor.md)
- [Savoury Dishes](savoury-dishes/arancini-rice-balls.md)
- [Utility & Misc](utility-misc/bean-soaking-pressure-cooking-guide.md)
- [Cocktails](cocktails/README.md) (see the dedicated cocktails index)

## Conventions

Measurements are metric-first. Historical or source-specific units are preserved where helpful. Frontmatter tags are lower-case and terse (e.g. `bread`, `ferment`, `cocktail`, `diy`).

## Source Attribution

Where a recipe is adapted, a Source section appears at the bottom with a canonical URL. Original and family recipes omit this section.
