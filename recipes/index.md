# Marcus' Recipe Book

Welcome to my personal collection of cooking, brewing, preserving and DIY utility recipes. This site is intentionally plain: fast to browse, easy to maintain, and entirely Markdown driven.

## Structure

- Baking & Sweets
- Preserves & Condiments
- Basics & Staples
- Brewing & Ferments
- Savoury Dishes
- Utility & Misc
- Guides
- Cocktails (see the dedicated cocktails index)

Use the left navigation to explore categories. Each recipe includes consistent frontmatter (slug, title, tags, category) to support future automation, search, and filtering.

## Conventions

Measurements are metric-first. Historical or source-specific units are preserved where helpful. Frontmatter tags are lower-case and terse (e.g. `bread`, `ferment`, `cocktail`, `diy`).

## Source Attribution

Where a recipe is adapted, a Source section appears at the bottom with a canonical URL. Original and family recipes omit this section.
