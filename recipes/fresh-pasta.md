# Fresh Pasta (Base + Variations)

## Ingredients (Base Dough)

- 200 g "00" flour (plus extra for dusting; semolina optional)
- 2 eggs (room temperature)

## Instructions (Base Dough)

1. Mound flour on work surface (or use a bowl). Make a well and add eggs.
2. Mix from center outward until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Knead 5–7 minutes until smooth, elastic, and slightly lighter in colour.
4. Wrap or cover and rest 10–20 minutes at room temperature.
5. Roll dough (hand or machine) to desired thickness (nearly translucent).
6. Cut to shape (e.g. tagliatelle, pappardelle, ravioli). Dust lightly with semolina.
7. Cook in abundant well‑salted boiling water 1–3 minutes until just tender. Drain and sauce immediately.

## Variation: Squid Ink Pasta

Add 6 g squid ink to the eggs before combining with flour. Proceed as base. Expect slightly softer dough; add a teaspoon of extra flour if tacky.

## Variation: Green (Spinach) Pasta

Replace 1 egg with 2 tbsp well‑squeezed spinach purée (blanched, drained, squeezed dry). Combine 1 egg + spinach with flour. If dry, add drops of water; if sticky, dust with flour.

## Scaling

Use ratio: 1 egg per 100 g flour. For larger batches multiply maintaining same proportion. For very large batches (>600 g flour) rest dough in divided pieces for easier rolling.
