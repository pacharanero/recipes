# NE IPA (Jon Finch Adaptation)

## Ingredients

- 5.0 kg pale ale malt
- 300 g crystal malt
- 300 g pale wheat malt
- 300 g flaked oats (with husk)
- 110 g Citra hops (pellets; split per schedule)
- 100 g Cashmere hops (pellets; split per schedule)
- 80 g Mosaic hops (pellets; split per schedule)
- 1 pack WHC Saturated yeast (11 g)

## Instructions

1. Mash grains in appropriate water volume at 65°C for 60 minutes.
2. Raise mash to 75°C and hold 10 minutes, then lauter/sparge to reach ~19 L pre‑boil volume targeting OG 1.072.
3. Boil 60 minutes. At 10 minutes remaining add: 30 g Citra + 30 g Cashmere.
4. Flame out: whirlpool/hop stand with 40 g Citra + 40 g Cashmere + 40 g Mosaic (temperature ~80°C if desired for aroma retention) for 20 minutes.
5. Chill wort quickly, transfer minimizing oxygen pickup. Pitch WHC Saturated yeast at 20°C. Ferment at 20°C until FG ~1.014 (ABV ≈ 7.4%).
6. Dry hop (single charge or split) with 40 g Citra + 30 g Cashmere + 40 g Mosaic for 7 days once primary activity subsides (or biotransformation: add part at high kräusen, remainder post-fermentation).
7. Cold crash carefully (optional), package minimizing oxygen (closed transfer to purged keg or primed bottles). Target minimal O2 exposure to preserve haze and hop aroma.
