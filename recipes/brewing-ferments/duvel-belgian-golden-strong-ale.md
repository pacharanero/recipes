# Duvel (Belgian Golden Strong Ale Clone)

## Ingredients

- 4.95 kg (10.9 lb) Belgian pilsner malt
- 950 g (2.1 lb) corn sugar (dextrose), added late in the boil
- 25 g (0.9 oz, ~5.4% AA) Styrian Goldings hops – 90 min
- 34 g (1.2 oz, ~4.5% AA) Saaz hops – 15 min
- Belgian strong ale yeast (e.g. WLP570, WY1388, or similar)
- 150 g (5.3 oz) white table sugar for priming (aim ~3.0–3.5 vols CO₂)
- Water: soft to moderately hard; keep sulfate moderate and chloride balanced

_Targets (approximate, for 19–20 L / 5.0–5.25 gal): OG ~1.074–1.084, FG 1.006–1.010, ABV ~8.5–9.5%, IBU mid-20s._

## Instructions

1. Mash crushed pilsner malt in 18 L (4.8 gal) of water at 65°C (149°F) for 90 minutes.
2. Vorlauf, run off, and sparge with 78°C (172°F) water to collect enough wort for a 90 minute boil (around 27–28 L / 7.1–7.4 gal pre-boil).
3. Bring to a rolling boil and add Styrian Goldings hops for the full 90 minutes.
4. With 15 minutes left in the boil, add Saaz hops and gradually stir in the corn sugar until fully dissolved.
5. At the end of the boil, chill the wort quickly to 18–19°C (64–66°F), then aerate well.
6. Transfer to a sanitized fermenter, leaving hop debris behind, and adjust volume to 19–20 L (5.0–5.25 gal) if needed.
7. Pitch a large, healthy starter of Belgian strong ale yeast (or two fresh packs).
8. Ferment at 18–19°C (64–66°F) for 2–3 days, then let the temperature rise to 22–24°C (72–75°F) to finish.
9. When gravity is stable in the target FG range (usually after 10–14 days), rack to secondary and condition 3–4 weeks at cool cellar temperature if possible.
10. Prime with 150 g (5.3 oz) sugar, bottle in heavy glass rated for high carbonation, and keep at 20–22°C (68–72°F) for 2–3 weeks to carbonate.
11. Age bottles cool (10–14°C / 50–57°F) for at least 6–8 weeks; the beer improves further with longer aging.
