# Dessert Sushi (Simplified)

## Ingredients

- Short grain sushi rice (approx 2 cups cooked)
- Assorted fruits: strawberry, kiwi, raspberry, watermelon, apple, cantaloupe
- Semi-sweet chocolate chips (for modelling chocolate)
- Agave or corn syrup
- Coconut milk
- Vanilla extract
- Almond paste (for faux wasabi)
- Lemon juice (acidulated water for apples)
- Red and green food colouring

## Instructions

1. Cook sushi rice; season lightly with coconut milk, vanilla, and a little agave for sweetness; cool.
2. Make modelling chocolate: melt chocolate chips gently; stir in agave syrup; chill until pliable, then roll between parchment.
3. Make pink “ginger”: slice apple paper-thin; soak briefly in lemon water tinted with red colouring; drain.
4. Colour a small lump of almond paste green for “wasabi”.
5. Form rolls: spread rice on sheet of modelling chocolate; lay fruit strips; roll and chill briefly; slice.
6. Form nigiri and gunkan styles with small rice mounds, fruit pieces, and chocolate strips.
7. Plate with apple “ginger” and almond paste “wasabi”; serve.
