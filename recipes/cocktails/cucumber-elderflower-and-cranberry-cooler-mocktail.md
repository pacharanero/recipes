# Cucumber, Elderflower and Cranberry Cooler Mocktail

## Ingredients

- 30 ml Monin Cucumber
- 25 ml Monin Elderflower
- 25 ml Monin Cranberry
- 10–15 ml Monin Lemon (start at 10 ml)
- Soda water (to top)
- Crushed ice

## Instructions

1. Fill a tall glass completely with crushed ice.
2. Pour syrups directly over the ice in this order: Cucumber, Elderflower, Cranberry, then Lemon (last, smallest measure).
3. Stir gently but thoroughly to combine with the crushed ice.
4. Top with cold soda water.

## Garnish

Lemon slice and cucumber slice.

## Why this works

- Cucumber (30 ml) gives body and freshness, and leads the profile.
- Elderflower and cranberry (25 ml each) bring floral sweetness and tart fruit in balance.
- Lemon at 10–15 ml lifts the drink without dominating.
- Crushed ice dilutes quickly, softening cranberry and lemon while keeping the drink refreshing.

## Fine-tuning

- **Still a bit sharp?**
  - Drop lemon to 8–10 ml.
  - Or add 5 ml elderflower.
- **Want it rounder / more “expensive” tasting?**
  - Add a tiny pinch of salt before topping with soda (a bar trick to reduce perceived acidity).
- **Want cucumber more obvious?**
  - Increase cucumber to 35 ml.
  - Or lightly muddle a fresh cucumber slice before adding ice.
