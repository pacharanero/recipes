# Fat Knackers (Stuffed Steak Rolls)

## Ingredients

- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
- Thin tenderised beef steaks (minute steaks)
- Salt and pepper
- Oil (for grilling)

## Instructions

1. Slowly cook onions in olive oil over low-medium heat until deeply caramelised; midway add brown sugar and red wine vinegar; cook to a jammy consistency. Cool slightly.
2. Lay out tenderised steaks; season lightly with salt and pepper. Place a tablespoon of onion mixture near one end; roll up and secure with cocktail sticks.
3. Grill over medium-high heat (or barbecue) turning until browned and cooked through (≈6–8 minutes) OR bake covered at 180°C / 350°F for 30–40 minutes with a splash of red wine.
4. Rest briefly; serve hot (also good cold next day).
