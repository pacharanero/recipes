### Seasoning (per 3 lb / 1.36 kg meat+fat)

- 28 g (1 oz) salt
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 2–3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tbsp brown sugar (optional)
- Spices to taste (e.g. paprika, chili, fennel)
- Splash (60 ml / ¼ cup) wine or liquor for marinade

## Instructions

1. Marinate lean meats in wine 12 hours chilled (optional for flavour).
2. Mince chilled lean meats through medium plate; dice fat small.
3. Combine meats with seasoning thoroughly until tacky.
4. Stuff into natural casings; tie links or coils loosely.
5. Hang at ≤21°C (70°F) for initial drain, then dry/cure in cool environment (12–15°C / 54–59°F) with airflow until firm and reduced in weight (several months). White surface mould is normal.
