***Peanut Choc Oat Protein Energy Bars***

***Ingredients (makes approx 12 bars)***

*330g (3/4cup) crunchy peanut butter*  
 *1/3 cup honey*  
 *2 tablespoons deodorised coconut oil*  
*2 cups rolled oats*  
 *1/2 cup USN chocolate protein powder — about 2 scoops*  
 *3 tablespoons flaxseeds, blended into powder in the blender*  
 *1/4 teaspoon salt*  
*25g 70% cocoa chocolate, chopped into chips*

***Method***

*Line an 8x8- or 9x9-inch baking pan with parchment paper*

*Melt the peanut butter, honey, and coconut oil together over hot water*

*Add the oats, protein powder, flaxseed, and salt. Stir to combine. The mixture will seem very dry at first but will come together as you stir. It won’t be sticky but should hold together when pressed. Press evenly into the tray and refrigerate overnight.*

*Lift the bars from the pan using the parchment handles and transfer to a cutting board. Slice into bars of desired size and enjoy.*

***Notes***

 *The consistency of the bars will vary based on the brand of peanut butter you use. If they seem too loose, add a tablespoon or two of extra oats. If they seem too dry, add additional peanut butter, honey, or even water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the bars hold together easily when pressed into the pan.*

 *Store at refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or freeze for up to 3 months.*
