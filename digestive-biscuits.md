# Digestive Biscuits

## Ingredients

- 150 g plain flour
- 1 tsp cream of tartar
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 75 g cold butter, cubed
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 1–2 tbsp cold water (as needed)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 190°C / 375°F (Gas 5). Lightly grease a baking tray.
2. In a large bowl whisk flour, cream of tartar, and baking soda.
3. Rub in butter until mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
4. Add beaten egg; mix, adding just enough water to form a soft pastry-like dough.
5. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to 3–6 mm (⅛–¼ in) thickness. Cut into rounds; place on tray.
6. Bake 10–15 minutes until golden. Cool briefly; transfer to wire rack.
7. Serve plain, with cheese, or spread with preserves.
