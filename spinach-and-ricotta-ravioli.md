# Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli

## Ingredients

### Pasta Dough

- 200 g (1⅔ cups) plain flour
- 2 eggs

### Filling

- 110 g (4 oz) spinach
- 1 egg yolk
- 55 g (2 oz) ricotta

## Instructions

1. Make dough: mix flour and eggs into a ball; knead briefly until smooth; wrap and rest 30 minutes.
2. Roll small portions through pasta machine repeatedly to thin sheets.
3. Blanch spinach 3 minutes; drain and squeeze dry; chop. Process spinach with egg yolk and ricotta; season.
