# Bean Soaking & Pressure Cooking Guide (Condensed)

## Ingredients (Base for Pressure Cooking Beans)

- Dried beans (variety of choice), sorted and rinsed
- Water (enough to cover beans by ~5 cm / 2 inches; do not exceed 1/2 cooker volume)
- 1–2 tbsp oil or fat (reduces foaming)

## Instructions

1. Soak most dried beans 4–8 hours (overnight). Exceptions: lentils, split peas, adzuki, black-eyed peas (no soak needed). Long-soaking big beans (favas, large limas) improve texture.
2. Drain and rinse soaked beans; add to pressure cooker with fresh water (cover by 2 inches) and 1–2 tbsp oil. Do not salt yet.
3. Lock lid; cook at 15 psi (adjust for your model) using recommended times: small/quick beans 8–10 min; medium beans (pinto, kidney, cannellini) 12 min; dense chickpeas 20–25 min; large soaked favas 4–5 min at 8–10 psi; lentils (unsoaked) 7–9 min; split peas 10 min (no soak).
4. Use natural pressure release for all beans to finish gently and reduce splitting.
5. Season to taste only after cooking (salt, acidic ingredients, tomatoes, citrus, vinegar). Add aromatics, herbs, or cooked vegetables as desired.
