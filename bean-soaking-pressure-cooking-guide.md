- 1–2 tbsp oil or fat (reduce foaming)

## Instructions

1. Soak most beans 4–8 h (skip for lentils, split peas, adzuki, black‑eyed peas). Large favas/limas benefit from soak.
2. Drain; fresh water + oil. No salt yet.
3. Pressure 15 psi: small 8–10 min; medium (pinto/kidney/cannellini) 12; chickpeas 20–25; large favas 4–5 min @ 8–10 psi; lentils 7–9; split peas 10.
