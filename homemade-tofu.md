# Homemade Tofu

## Ingredients

- 1.18 L (5 cups) plain homemade soymilk
- 120 ml (½ cup) water
- 22 ml (1½ tbsp) fresh lemon juice (coagulant)

## Instructions

1. Combine water and lemon juice (coagulant). Heat soymilk in a large pot to 71°C / 160°F, stirring to prevent scorching (or bring just to a boil then cool slightly 2–3 minutes while stirring).
2. Off heat, stir in half the coagulant 1–2 minutes. Stop stirring; add remaining coagulant and gently stir in a figure-eight until curds begin forming.
3. Cover pot; let stand 10–15 minutes until separation complete. Liquid (whey) should be yellowish-clear; add a few drops more lemon juice only if still milky.
4. Line a colander or steaming basket with several layers of cheesecloth over a bowl. Ladle curds into cloth.
5. Gather cloth; drain excess liquid. Shape curds into a loaf; press with a board and ~1 kg (2–3 lb) weight for 30–60 minutes (longer press = firmer tofu).
6. Unwrap and place tofu block in very cold water to firm further. Use immediately or store submerged in water (change daily) up to 1 week; can freeze for different texture.
