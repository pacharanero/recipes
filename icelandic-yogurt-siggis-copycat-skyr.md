# Icelandic Yogurt (Siggi’s Copycat Skyr)

## Ingredients

- 1 gallon skim milk
- 1 vanilla bean, slit lengthwise, caviar scraped
- 2/3 cup Siggi's plain or vanilla skyr (or plain/vanilla Greek yogurt as starter)
- 4 drops liquid vegetable rennet (or 2 drops double strength rennet)
- 1/4 cup cool, non-chlorinated water

## Instructions

1. Add the skim milk, vanilla bean, and vanilla caviar to a large, heavy-bottomed, non-reactive pot. Slowly bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until it reaches 185°F–190°F (85°C–88°C).
2. Remove from heat and let cool to 110°F (43°C).
3. Whisk together the skyr (or starter yogurt) and 1 cup of the cooled milk until smooth. Stir this mixture back into the pot.
4. Whisk the rennet into the cool water, then stir into the milk mixture for about 1 minute.
5. Cover the pot with a lid and a thick towel. Place in a warm, draft-free spot (or in an oven with the light on) for about 12 hours.
6. Line a colander with a double thickness of cheesecloth or muslin. Spoon the curds into the colander, removing the vanilla bean. Let drain in a cool place for 4–8 hours, reserving the whey.
7. Transfer the strained curds to a bowl. Beat with a hand mixer, adding 1 tablespoon of reserved whey at a time, until silky and smooth.
8. Sweeten to taste when serving. Reserve 1/2 cup of the finished yogurt to culture your next batch.
