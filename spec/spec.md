# Recipe Markdown Conversion Instructions

To ensure consistency when converting recipes to Markdown, follow these persistent prompt instructions:

## 1. Title

- Use a single H1 heading for the recipe name at the top of the file.

## 2. Ingredients

- Use an H2 heading (`## Ingredients`).
- List all ingredients as bullet points, one per line, with clear measurements and preparation notes.
- Exclude any non-essential commentary or tips.

## 3. Instructions

- Use an H2 heading (`## Instructions`).
- Write the method as a numbered list, with each step as a single, clear instruction.
- Only include essential steps for making the recipe. Omit tips, serving suggestions, and non-essential commentary.

## 4. Formatting

- Do not include images, links, or promotional content.
- Use plain Markdown only.
- Use metric and imperial units if both are provided; otherwise, preserve the original units.

## 5. Exclusions

- Exclude all non-recipe content: introductions, stories, nutrition, comments, reviews, and advertisements.
- Only include ingredients and method required to make the recipe.

## 6. File Naming

- Save each recipe as a Markdown file with a slugified name (lowercase, hyphens for spaces, no special characters).

## 7. Update spec.md
- If new recipes require deviation from the guidelines in this document, update this spec.md file to reflect those changes.
