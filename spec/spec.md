# Recipe Markdown Conversion Instructions

To ensure consistency when converting recipes to Markdown, follow these persistent prompt instructions:

## Title

- Use a single H1 heading for the recipe name at the top of the file.

## Ingredients

- Use an H2 heading (`## Ingredients`).
- List all ingredients as bullet points, one per line, with clear measurements and preparation notes.
- Exclude any non-essential commentary or tips.
- If non-metric units are used, add a conversion to metric in parentheses after the original unit.

## Instructions

- Use an H2 heading (`## Instructions`).
- Write the method as a numbered list, with each step as a single, clear instruction.
- Only include essential steps for making the recipe. Omit tips, serving suggestions, and non-essential commentary.
- If non-metric units are used, add a conversion to metric in parentheses after the original unit.

## Photography

- If there is a single best photo representing the recipe, include it below the Instructions section.
- It should be centred, and approx 50% of the width of the page. Multiple photos can be used, they should be gridded or in a carousel.
- Photos should be renamed to the same filename as the recipe's markdown file and stored in `recipes/photos/`.

## Language and Spelling

- Use British English spellings eg. sanit*ise* not sanit*ize*.

## Formatting

- Do not include images, links, or promotional content (except a final source URL per the Source Attribution section).
- Use plain Markdown only.
- Use metric and imperial units if both are provided; otherwise, preserve the original units.

## Exclusions

- Exclude all non-recipe content: introductions, stories, nutrition, comments, reviews, and advertisements.
- Only include ingredients and method required to make the recipe.

## File Naming and location

- Save each recipe in the `recipes/<category-folder>/` directory that matches its README section.
- Save each recipe as a Markdown file with a slugified name (lowercase, hyphens for spaces, no special characters).

## Update the README.md which serves as an index of all recipes.

- Add a link for the new recipe to the index
- Follow the style of existing links
- Use section headers for different types of recipe
- Under each section alphabetical order is fine

## Navigation Links

- When linking to category sections from the main index, link to the first recipe alphabetically in that category rather than attempting to create category index pages.
- Users can then use the site navigation to browse within categories.

## Update spec.md

- If new recipes require deviation from the guidelines in this document, update this spec.md file to reflect those changes.

## Source Attribution (Web-Derived Recipes)

- If a recipe is adapted or transcribed from a publicly available webpage, append a `## Source` section at the end of the file.
- Use a markdown link prefixed by one of: `Source:`, `Adapted from:`, or `Inspired by:` depending on the level of change.
- Do not include tracking parameters if avoidable; keep the canonical URL only.
- Omit the section entirely for original or fully self-authored recipes.

## Local Testing

- Local developer testing of the site is achieved using Docker and Docker Compose, using the included Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
- Convenience scripts are provided in the `s/` folder for common tasks like starting the docker-compose environment.
- Don't create local Virtualenvs or install packages globally on the host system, instead always use the Docker environment for consistency.

## Website creation

- The content here will be published to the web as a GitHub Pages site using a static site generator
- The static site generator to use is Mintlify
- Publication should be automatic using an appropriate GitHub Action

## YAML Frontmatter

All recipe Markdown files created or updated from now on MUST begin with a YAML frontmatter block of the form:

```
---
slug: <auto-generated-or-file-name-slug>
title: <Recipe Title>
tags: [category, key-ingredient, technique]
category: <Primary Category>
---
```

Guidelines:

- `slug`: normally matches filename (without extension).
- `tags`: 3–8 short, lowercase tags (e.g. `bread`, `breakfast`, `yeast`, `boiled`, `cheese`, `vegetarian`).
- `category`: one of existing README sections (e.g. Baking & Sweets, Preserves & Condiments, Basics & Staples, Brewing, Savoury Dishes, Guides if added later).

Frontmatter precedes the H1 heading (the H1 still required for readability).

### Categories

Use exactly one of these for `category`:

- Baking & Sweets
- Preserves & Condiments
- Basics & Staples
- Brewing
- Savoury Dishes
- Utility & Misc (non-food craft, household, equipment guides)
- Guides (long-form technique references)
- Drinks (cocktails and mixed beverages)

---

These instructions should be referenced for all future recipe conversions to Markdown in this project.
